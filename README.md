# Intro

This is the final assignment for the course EDA487. Some patches where made for the 
device to run the code, but the game in itself works perfectly on the actual hardware. 

The course was set up as an introduction to the C language on embedded devices, including writing
display and keypad drivers for peripherals connected though GPIO, including internal and external
interrupts.
